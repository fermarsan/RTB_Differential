# Differential Steering Examples

This repository includes some simple simulation examples of mobile Differential Robotics platform on [Python Robotics ToolBox](https://pythonrobotics.io/). 

The robot model receive the speed of each side of the platform:

$$
v_l(t)
$$

$$
v_r(t)
$$

and return the position and direction of the robot:

$$
X(t) = \left[ x(t), \ y(t), \ \theta(t) \right]
$$
